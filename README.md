# 2019-Fall-MIS-SA-Project-TeaShop-JavaOO-Server  

## Cousre Objectice
This a compulsory 'system anlysis' course in junior. We use java object-oriented method to create a MVC debug server on Eclipse IDE. No back-end framework is implemented. 

There are 3 documentation made before moving on the project. You can find the user requriment, database design, UML diagrams in these documentation.

The system provide users with viewing menu, purchase drinks, viewing order, and a user account functions. Shopkeeper may view all the information of users, products, orders. And may alter some of them.
